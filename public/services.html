            <h2>Express Entry</h2>
            <blockquote>
                One of Canada’s fastest and most favourable immigration schemes is Express Entry. It takes about six months for candidates who apply through this program to receive permanent residence status.
                The Express Entry system uses a Comprehensive Ranking System to score online immigration requests from experienced workers. But to submit an application, you have to be qualified under one of three Express Entry programs:
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— Federal Skilled Trades:</b></header>
                For skilled workers who are qualified and have experience
                You need an official job offer or a certificate of qualification 
                <br><br>

                <header><b>— Federal Skilled Worker:</b> </header>
                For skilled workers with experience overseas
                Minimum requirements of language and education
                <br><br>

                <header><b>— Canadian Experience Class:</b></header>
                For skilled workers with at least 3 years of Canadian work experience. 
                The Canadian government will then send out invites for the highest-ranking applicants in the Express Entry backlog to apply for permanent residence.
                If your application is approved, you will receive a confirmation of permanent residence and a permanent residence visa if your country requires a visa.
                On average, it costs between $2,300 and $4, 500 to immigrate to Canada through Express Entry, including extra settlement funds. The settlement funds will vary according to family size.
                <br><br>

                Let's help you evaluate your eligibility, prepare the needed documents, and take the right steps to ease your application process.

            <h2>Family Sponsorship</h2>
            <blockquote>
                Canada has quite a few immigration options that allow citizens to sponsor their family members to come to the country. Certain family members are eligible to become permanent residents of Canada through these programs, and the best part is that it has a reduced processing period.
                <br><br>
                You may be eligible to sponsor your spouse, child, parent or grandparent, or even an orphaned relative in some specific cases. In exceptional cases, permanent Residents or Canadian citizens may be allowed to assist one extended relative to immigrate to Canada as long as you're regarded as a "Lonely Canadian".
                <br><br>
                To be eligible for a family sponsorship program, you must meet certain requirements. The minimum conditions are:
                <br><br>
                <header><b>a.</b> You must be a citizen or permanent resident</header>
                <br><br>
                <header><b>b.</b> You must be at least 18 years old live in Canada or intend to return once your spouse or partner becomes a permanent resident</header>
                <br><br>
                <header><b>c.</b> You must be prepared to meet your family member's basic financial needs for three years</header>
                <br><br> 
                
                However, it is possible for a citizen or permanent resident to be ineligible for this program:
                <br><br>
                <header><b>1.</b> If the person hasn't made child support or alimony payments</header>
                <br><br> 
                <header><b>2.</b> If they have missed immigration loan payment, made late payment, or failed to make any payment at all</header>
                <br><br> 
                <header><b>3.</b> If they have declared bankruptcy</header>
                <br><br> 
                <header><b>4.</b> If they have been convicted of a violent crime or are currently in prison</header>
                <br><br>
                Sponsoring a loved one to immigrate can be a bit complicated and draggy. But don't worry. We've got you covered. We will assist in making it as easy as possible.

            <h2>Work Permit</h2>
            <blockquote>
                Every foreigner or temporary resident needs a work permit to be able to work in Canada. 
                Every year, Canada issues hundreds of thousands of temporary work permits every year to foreigners from around the world.
                <br><br>
                There are several types of  work permits that can be issued in Canada. Each of these options has different eligibility requirements and needs different qualifications. 
                Some permits require an employment letter from a Canadian employer, others require a form of history or connection to the nation.
                <br><br>
                Canadian work permits can be grouped under two broad categories:
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— Temporary Foreign Worker Program</b></header>
                In this case, the employer needs to have a good Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) to hire foreigners. The employer must also apply to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). The aim is to prove that they couldn't get a citizen or permanent resident, and that they need a temporary worker to fill labour shortages. 
                A foreign worker can only apply for a work permit after the employer gets a positive LMIA.
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— International Mobility Program</b></header>
                This is a permit that doesn't need an LMIA. There are several schemes that don't require an LMIA. 
                For instance, open or closed work permits can be provided based on certain circumstances like eligibility under trade agreements, country of origin, education, and so on.
                <br><br>
                <h5>How To Apply for a Work Permit</h5> 
                The process of applying will depend on the type of work permit you need. Knowing which permit is right for you is the first step. After that, you will need to provide important documents. 
                Some of the documents you may be required to provide include your biometrics, police clearance, passport-sized photos, among other things.
                <br><br>
                If you are a bit confused about what to do, we will guide you through the application and activation of your work permit.

            <h2>Work Visa</h2>
            <blockquote>
                The Canadian government issues different visas depending on the purpose of an immigrant's visit to the nation. 
                A work visa allows a foreign national to enter Canada in search of employment opportunities. 
                It is an endorsement by immigration authorities that gives an immigrant permission to enter the country to work.
                <br><br>
                There's a common confusion about the difference between a work permit and a work visa, especially for people who are new to the Canadian immigration process.
                <br><br>
                A work visa is a stamp on your passport that grants you permission to enter Canada. 
                Your visa has an expiry date, which is the date until which you can enter Canada legally. 
                However, it doesn't define how long you can stay in Canada. However, a work permit tells you how long you can legally work in Canada and what you are authorized to do while in the country.
                <br><br>
                <h5>How To be Eligible</h5>
                Any immigrant who wants to work in Canada temporarily must meet the following eligibility criteria:
                <br><br>
                <header><b>a. </b>They must be willing to leave the country when their work permit expires or becomes invalid</header>
                <br><br>
                <header><b>b. </b>They must respect all the conditions of their work permit</header>
                <br><br> 
                <header><b>c. </b>They must not work for an ineligible employer or one who is engaged in any work that is prohibited </header>
                <br><br>
                With a Canadian work visa, you can stay in the country as long as your permit is valid. 
                During this period, you are expected to work based on the conditions of your permit. 
                This simply means you can still stay and work in Canada legally even when your visa expires.
                <br><br>
                If you are unsure about whether or not you can work in Canada, then you're in the right place. 
                Our job is to make your immigration journey as easy and exciting as possible.

            <h2>Business Visa</h2>
            <blockquote>
                Getting a business visa in Canada will depend on an immigrant's capacity to establish themselves and contribute to the economy of a Canadian province or territory. 
                People who can start up and manage a business in Canada, as well as invest in its growth and development are the only candidates qualified for this program.
                <br><br>
                There are two types of Canadian business immigrants:
                <br><br>
                <header><b>1. </b>Those who are given a start-up visa</header>
                <br><br>
                <header><b>2. </b>Those who are self-employed</header>
                <br><br>
                To be eligible for a start-up visa, you must be able to
                <br><br>
                <header><b>a. </b>Communicate in either English or French</header>
                <br><br>
                <header><b>b. </b>Support from a business incubator, venture capital fund, or angel investment group</header>
                <br><br>
                <header><b>c. </b>Sufficient funds to take care of living in Canada before you start earning money</header>
                <br><br>
                To be eligible for self employment, you must have
                <br><br>
                <header><b>a. </b>Experience to contribute to the development of Canadian culture</header>
                <br><br>
                <header><b>b. </b>Agricultural experience, and an intention to buy and run a farm in Canada.</header>
                <br><br>
                However, being a foreign investor or business owner is one thing. 
                Getting permanent residence or citizenship in Canada as a business owner is another.
                There are a number of immigration options that allow entrepreneurs to become permanent residents and citizens. 
                These options include:
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— </b>Executive Express Entry</header>
                <br><br>

                <br><br>
                <header><b>— </b>Start-up Company</header>
                <br><br>
                Once your business has been registered, you can apply for permanent residency as the manager of your business. 
                However, you will still need to meet certain requirements, and they can include any of the following:
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— </b>A high school degree or higher</header>
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— </b>A police clearance</header>
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— </b>A clean bill of health</header>
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— </b>A good score for your language skills (at least CLB 7)</header>
                <br><br>
                Investors, business owners, and entrepreneurs have different options under the business visa program. This means that you need a good strategy to increase your chances of success. 
                Let us help you take the right step and make the smartest choices. Begin by applying now.

            <blockquote>
                The Canadian government offers permanent residency to thousands of people every single year. 
                A permanent resident is someone who isn't a Canadian citizen, but has been offered permanent resident status in Canada. 
                Being a permanent resident comes with benefits similar to being a Canadian citizen.
                <br><br>
                However, to enjoy the benefits of being a permanent resident, they must meet certain obligations
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— </b>Within five years, they must be physically present in Canada for at least 730 days</header>
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— </b>They live outside of Canada but have worked full-time for a Canadian company or in the government</header>

                <br><br>
                When a permanent resident applies for a permanent resident card renewal, a permanent resident travel document (PRTD), or Canadian citizenship, it is usually determined whether they have satisfied their residency obligations.
