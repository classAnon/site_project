                The Canadian government offers permanent residency to thousands of people every single year. 
                A permanent resident is someone who isn't a Canadian citizen, but has been offered permanent resident status in Canada. 
                Being a permanent resident comes with benefits similar to being a Canadian citizen.
                <br><br>
                However, to enjoy the benefits of being a permanent resident, they must meet certain obligations
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— </b>Within five years, they must be physically present in Canada for at least 730 days</header>
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— </b>They live outside of Canada but have worked full-time for a Canadian company or in the government</header>
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— </b>They are accompanying a spouse or common-law partner who is a Canadian citizen, or they are accompanying a parent who is a Canadian citizen</header>
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— </b>They are the accompanying kid or spouse of a Canadian citizen who is working full-time outside the nation or works for Canada in the public sector</header>
                <br><br>
                When a permanent resident applies for a permanent resident card renewal, a permanent resident travel document (PRTD), or Canadian citizenship, it is usually determined whether they have satisfied their residency obligations.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Immigration Programs for Permanent Residence, Canada</h5>
                There are five main schemes for permanent residence in Canada. They include:
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— Express Entry</b></header>
                With a good CRS score, you can apply for permanent residence through economic immigration programs.
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— Canadian Experience Class</b></header>
                This program gives temporary residents (either workers or students) an opportunity to apply for permanent residency.
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— Business Immigration</b></header>
                This is an opportunity for immigrants who have experience with owning and running a business.
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— Family Class Immigration</b></header>
                Citizens and permanent residents can sponsor their loved ones to immigrate and apply for residency.
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— Provincial Nominee Program</b></header>
                This program is for workers who have the necessary skills, experience and education to contribute to the development of a Canadian province. 
                <br><br>
                The permanent residence application process can be time consuming and stressful. 
                There are thousands of people applying each year, including temporary residents. 
                But we are here to help you achieve your goal. Get started by applying below.
