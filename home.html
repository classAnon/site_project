                <p class="subtext">
                    Canada has quite a few immigration options that allow citizens to sponsor their family members to come to the country. 
                    Certain family members are eligible to become permanent residents of Canada through these programs, and the best part is that it has a reduced processing period.</p>

                <p class="subtext">
                    Fully vaccinated travellers no longer need a pre-arrival COVID-19 test to enter Canada. 
                    Travellers will still need to provide proof of vaccination status and all other mandatory information through the ArriveCAN app, either on desktop or mobile, before crossing the border. 
                    Travellers who arrive without completing their ArriveCAN submission may have to test on arrival and quarantine for 14 days, regardless of their vaccination status. 
                    Travellers taking a cruise or a plane must submit their information in ArriveCAN within 72 hours before boarding.
                    Partially-vaccinated and unvaccinated travellers will still be subject to testing and quarantine requirements.</p>

                <h5>IRCC eases overseas biometrics requirement for some Ukrainians</h5>
                <p class="subtext">Effective immediately, certain Ukrainians looking to move to Canada will no longer need to submit their biometrics at Visa Application Centres (VACs) overseas.

                    IRCC has identified 3 cohorts of individuals that are low risk and therefore biometric screening can be eased to expedite processing. IRCC is easing requirements for three cohorts of people, including:
                    
                    Clients aged 14-17
                    Clients over 60
                    Clients with previous Canadian visas and no derogatory immigration history, who hold supporting documents
                    Biometrics are not required for children under age 14.</p>

                <h5>Canada landed 300,000 immigrants in first quarter Of 2022</h5>
                <p class="subtext">Obtained by CTI News in an information request to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), the data shows Canada has gotten off to a strong start as it seeks to welcome over 400,000
                     new immigrants for the second consecutive year. Under its new Immigration Levels Plan 2022-2024, Canada is targeting nearly 432,000 new immigrant landings this year, which would be the highest level in history.
                      Last year Canada landed over 405,000 immigrants, primarily by transitioning those living in the country to permanent residence. It marked a record-breaking year for Canada, and was the first time since 1913 the country landed over 400,000 immigrants.</p>
