                    Canada Immigration and Visa Consulate made my dream come through.
                    I was eager for an opportunity to visit the country. I had that sorted out by the 
                    agent that handled my application. Everything moved quickly. After visiting, i already decided that I was going 
                    to be back for my Masters program. I reached out to the company again after 2 years and they helped me again.
                    I highly recommend this company!!!

                <h5>Vaccine regulations for domestic travelers and transportation workers will be phased down in Canada</h5>
                <p class="subtext">
                    Canada will suspend vaccination mandates for domestic and international travel, federally controlled transportation sectors, and federal government employees as of 00:01 Eastern Time on June 20.
                    <br><br>
                    The suspension of vaccine mandates, according to Canadian government officials, shows a better public health situation in the country. 
                    COVID-19 has been vaccinated against by nearly 90% of Canadians, and the number of cases has dropped.
                    <br><br>
                    Vaccination regulations for cruise ship passengers and crew will continue to be enforced. 
                    On flights and trains, other prevention efforts, such as wearing a mask, remain in effect.

                <p class="subtext">
                    According to Immigration, Refugees & Citizenship Canada (IRCC), couples and families with several adults will soon be able to apply for citizenship online.
                    <br><br>
                    At the moment, only single adult applicants can apply for citizenship online. Adults may be able to register together in the fall of 2022, according to an email from IRCC to CIC News. 
                    After that, minors and families will be able to access the web portal.
                    <br><br>
                    According to CIC News, IRCC will begin developing extra capabilities for representatives after the e-application is implemented. 
                    Representatives can currently only assist clients with online applications and cannot submit them on their own. 
                    They have the ability to communicate with IRCC on behalf of the applicant both before and after the online application has been submitted.

                <h5>Express Entry is now available for 16 new occupation categories</h5>
                <p class="subtext">
                    Many modifications and updates have recently been made to Canada's immigration system as the country strives to get back on track following the pandemic.
                    <br><br>
                    Many provinces in Canada are aggressively recruiting for individuals to fill these jobs as labor shortages reach an all-time high, and are actively giving many international workers abroad the option for a fresh start.
                    <br><br>
                    The IRCC is revising the NOC code system, which will be deployed in November 2022, as previously stated. With this latest update, 16 additional occupations have been added to the Express Entry eligibility list.
