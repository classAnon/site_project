            <blockquote>
                Every foreigner or temporary resident needs a work permit to be able to work in Canada. 
                Every year, Canada issues hundreds of thousands of temporary work permits every year to foreigners from around the world.
                <br><br>
                There are several types of  work permits that can be issued in Canada. Each of these options has different eligibility requirements and needs different qualifications. 
                Some permits require an employment letter from a Canadian employer, others require a form of history or connection to the nation.
                <br><br>
                Canadian work permits can be grouped under two broad categories:
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— Temporary Foreign Worker Program</b></header>
                In this case, the employer needs to have a good Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) to hire foreigners. The employer must also apply to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). The aim is to prove that they couldn't get a citizen or permanent resident, and that they need a temporary worker to fill labour shortages. 
                A foreign worker can only apply for a work permit after the employer gets a positive LMIA.
                <br><br>
                <header><b>— International Mobility Program</b></header>
                This is a permit that doesn't need an LMIA. There are several schemes that don't require an LMIA. 
                For instance, open or closed work permits can be provided based on certain circumstances like eligibility under trade agreements, country of origin, education, and so on.
                <br><br>
                <h5>How To Apply for a Work Permit</h5> 
                The process of applying will depend on the type of work permit you need. Knowing which permit is right for you is the first step. After that, you will need to provide important documents. 
                Some of the documents you may be required to provide include your biometrics, police clearance, passport-sized photos, among other things.
                <br><br>
                If you are a bit confused about what to do, we will guide you through the application and activation of your work permit.

            <blockquote>
                The Canadian government issues different visas depending on the purpose of an immigrant's visit to the nation. 
                A work visa allows a foreign national to enter Canada in search of employment opportunities. 
                It is an endorsement by immigration authorities that gives an immigrant permission to enter the country to work.
                <br><br>
                There's a common confusion about the difference between a work permit and a work visa, especially for people who are new to the Canadian immigration process.
                <br><br>
                A work visa is a stamp on your passport that grants you permission to enter Canada. 
                Your visa has an expiry date, which is the date until which you can enter Canada legally. 
                However, it doesn't define how long you can stay in Canada. However, a work permit tells you how long you can legally work in Canada and what you are authorized to do while in the country.
                <br><br>
                <h5>How To be Eligible</h5>
                Any immigrant who wants to work in Canada temporarily must meet the following eligibility criteria:
                <br><br>
                <header><b>a. </b>They must be willing to leave the country when their work permit expires or becomes invalid</header>
                <br><br>
                <header><b>b. </b>They must respect all the conditions of their work permit</header>
                <br><br> 
                <header><b>c. </b>They must not work for an ineligible employer or one who is engaged in any work that is prohibited </header>
                <br><br>
                With a Canadian work visa, you can stay in the country as long as your permit is valid. 
                During this period, you are expected to work based on the conditions of your permit. 
                This simply means you can still stay and work in Canada legally even when your visa expires.
                <br><br>
                If you are unsure about whether or not you can work in Canada, then you're in the right place. 
                Our job is to make your immigration journey as easy and exciting as possible.
